	  <h1>Construction</h1>
	  <p>A selection of a few devices and designs I have worked on over the years,
	  ranging from R&D prototypes to purely decorative.</p>

	    <h2>Snowflake Generator</h2>
		  <p>This construction project was initiated with the goal of manufacturing a prototype
        of a machine that can "generate" snow as close as possible to natural snowflakes and 
		  ice crystals occuring in clouds. The produced snow was intended to be used in the
		  lab for optical particle measurement and aerodynmic experiments.</p>
		  <p>The apparatus went through several different design stages, with a preliminary study
		  that recommended a sophisticated cloud chamber design with full climate control.
		  However, this initial design proved unaffordable, both in terms of research budget and
		  necessary FTEs for deployment.</p>
      <img src="images/initial_cloud_design.png" alt="Initial Cloud Chamber Design" width="100%" height="100%">
		  <p>Based on the experience gained in the initial study, a much more affordable design
		  was developed. Here, evaporated water is guided into a balloon-like structure, where it 
		  can freeze into ice crystals and snow flakes under the right conditions.</p>
      <img src="images/operational_cloud.jpeg" alt="Operational Cloud Chamber" width="100%" height="100%">
		  <p>This design was developed from start to finish and a functional prototype was assembled and 
		  operated in a lab environment. Parts of the frame had to be custom-built and 3D printing
		  proved to be instrumental in this process.</p>
      <img src="images/produced_snow.jpeg" alt="Snow Harvest" width="100%" height="100%">
      <p>Further possible improvements of the design will include a larger "cloud" volume and
		  an improved control of the thermodynamic variables temperature and water vapor concentration.
		  </p>

        <h2>Generative Design</h2>
        <p>
          The figure below shows an STL file of a figure-8 immersion of a Klein bottle, ready for 3D printing. The file was generated using a Python script.
